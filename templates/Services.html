    <h2>Humming-Based Music Search</h2>
    <p>Our primary service is a humming-based music search function that allows users to search for songs by humming a melody or a part of the lyrics. Our advanced machine learning algorithms analyze the user's humming and match it with songs in our database, providing accurate and relevant search results.</p>
    <h2>Music Information and Lyrics</h2>
    <p>In addition to humming-based search, our platform also provides various information about the songs such as lyrics, artist information, and album information. Users can also create playlists, save their favorite songs, and share them with friends.</p>
    <h2>Music Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Our platform also provides personalized music recommendations based on users' listening history and preferences. Our machine learning algorithms analyze users' listening patterns and suggest new songs that match their taste.</p>
